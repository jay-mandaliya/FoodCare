<b>Food Care</b>
\nFoodCare is an app that connects people to quickly sell surplus fresh food that would otherwise end up in the trash.\n\nPeople end up tossing good food in landfills for many reasons.Either it is nearing its expiry date, it isn’t “pretty” enough for the shelves, they have extra products they aren’t able to sell in time, or a variety of other reasons.\n\nAt the same time, food prices are constantly on the rise and smart consumers are looking for ways to reduce their grocery bill, while still enjoying delicious, nutritious food.
