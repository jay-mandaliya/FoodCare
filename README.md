# FoodCare

### Project Definition
-----
Food care is a platform which allows user to sell their surplus food at a reasonable rate and make some money out of it, and, on the other hand, people who need that item can buy it without burning a hole in their pocket. All age users will use this application and it will be beneficial, especially to women who struggle a bit in maintaining budget and daily expenses because of overpriced food items available in the market. 

Food care includes various functionalities which will provide users ease of using the application.

### Issues
During the development phase, we encountered several problems and resolved them accordingly.  As per our decided milestones, we started working initially, and during the designing, development, and testing, we encountered some issues listed below as per the milestones.
1.	Milestone 1
During the first phase of the project, which was designing and prototyping, we faced some issues related to the placement of the map and selecting a proper flow. Other than that, our team got some of the minor problems in database designing and integration. As we all were new to the firebase system, it took some time to try and test functionalities of firebase and integrating it with android.

2.	Milestone 2
After successful firebase integration and designing, during 2 phases of the project, we faced problems like; managing the data using firebase, testing firebase authentications for user logins and signup, and creating and managing database schema for storing information of products. 

3.	Milestone 3
After the completion of basic functionalities, we moved further in the development of advanced features. In this milestone, we face lots of issues. As we were going to integrate the GPS system in the application, there were some significant challenges we faced during the implementation of the functionality. Other than that, for uploading the image of items camera is used. This functionality claimed a lot of effort as images were meant to be stored on the database and especially in some files. Thus, understating and implementing it took some more time.

4.	Milestone 4
The final phase of the milestone includes the testing part. But as we were running somewhat behind schedule, some parts of code integration with frontend was remaining. The major issue was to merge all the codes done on different branched by team members. There were some bugs in implementations which we found later while testing the application. After the bugs were fixed and code was merged, the final review and check of the app were carried out by all the team members individually.


### FURTHER ENHANCEMENT 
---
There are many scopes of improvements in the application, and in the future, we can add some of the bonus functionalities. As per the project plan, the app has one bonus functionality implemented in it as it is of searching the product based on category. Other than this, we have additional features which can be applied.
*	Scan products using the barcode provided.
*	Implementing chat feature between seller and buyer.
*	Integrating payment gateway.
*	Helping home delivery.
*	Posting the food interest and socialize.
